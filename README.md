# Factorio Overview
![Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/) is a 2020 videogame released by Czech Studio Wube Software where you build and maintain automatic factories to launch a rocket and produce "science." With the game being in the sandbox genre, many designs of machine layouts are possible. This website will provide recommended layouts and tips for optimal production.

# Belt Thouroughput
All info will be in the rate of items/sec.<br>

# Belt Balancer
Belt balancers evenly distribute items over multiple belts.
- All items are take evenly
- All items are outputed evenly
The most popular belt balancer is the 4x4.<br>

# Science Production Equality
Different sciences require different amounts of machines to produce the same rate equally. Here are the ratios:<br>
![Image](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/Automation_science_pack.png)<sub>5 machines of any tier<sub/><br>
![Image](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/Logistic_science_pack.png)<sub>6 machines of any tier<sub/><br>
![Image](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/Military_science_pack.png)<sub>5 machines of any tier<sub/><br>
![Image](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/Chemical_science_pack.png)<sub>12 machines of any tier<sub/><br>
![Image](https://wiki.factorio.com/images/Production_science_pack.png)<sub>7 machines of any tier<sub/><br>
